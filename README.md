# Human-activity-recognition
## Human action recognition in still images with deep learning
In this project we tried several convolutional neural network models to find the proper fit for our dataset.    <br />
We used Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Mobilenetv2, Resnet and Xception. With these models we also tried several regularization methods like data augmentation and transfer learning. <br />
The dataset that we used is Stanford 40 Action dataset. And we achieved highest accuracy value result with Xception model using data augmentation.                             <br />
